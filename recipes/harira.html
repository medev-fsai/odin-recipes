    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Moroccan Harira is a fragrant, heartwarming soup that captures the essence of Morocco in every spoonful. Slow-simmered tomatoes, tender chickpeas, and wholesome lentils create a rich, comforting base, while a blend of traditional spices—ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, and saffron—adds depth and warmth. Fresh herbs like cilantro and parsley bring a lively brightness, making each bite both nourishing and flavorful.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditionally enjoyed to break the fast during Ramadan, harira is more than just a meal—it’s a celebration of flavor and hospitality. A splash of lemon adds a subtle tang, lifting the earthy richness of the soup, while its silky texture and vibrant aroma make it a dish that invites connection, conversation, and comfort at the table.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
