    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Slow-braised to tender perfection, Moroccan meat tagine is a celebration of warmth, spice, and time-honored tradition. Succulent cuts of meat are gently cooked with caramelized onions, garlic, and a fragrant blend of Moroccan spices—think cumin, ginger, saffron, and a whisper of cinnamon—until every bite is deeply flavorful. The slow cooking allows the sauce to become rich and velvety, infused with aromas that instantly transport you to a bustling souk.

    <p>
        Finished with touches that balance savory and sweet, this iconic dish often features plump dried fruits, toasted almonds, or fresh herbs for contrast and texture. Served piping hot and best enjoyed with warm bread to scoop up every last drop, Moroccan meat tagine is comforting, soulful, and irresistibly satisfying—a true centerpiece meant to be shared.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>General ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Meat (lamb, beef, or veal)</strong>: The heart of the dish; slow cooking makes it tender and allows it to absorb the spices deeply.</li>
            <li><strong>Onions</strong>: Slowly melt into the sauce, adding natural sweetness and richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic</strong>: Provides a warm, savory base that deepens the overall flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive oil</strong>: Used for gentle cooking and to bind all flavors together smoothly.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground cumin</strong>: Brings earthy warmth and a signature Moroccan aroma.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground ginger</strong>: Adds brightness and subtle heat that balances the richness.</li>
            <li><strong>Black pepper</strong>: Enhances the spices with mild heat and depth.</li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon (stick or ground)</strong>: Introduces gentle sweetness that complements the meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Saffron threads (or turmeric)</strong>: Adds fragrance and color; saffron is floral while turmeric is earthy.</li>
            <li><strong>Fresh cilantro and/or parsley</strong>: Lifts the dish with freshness and herbal contrast.</li>
            <li><strong>Dried fruits (prunes, apricots, or dates)</strong>: Provide a sweet counterpoint to the savory sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Toasted almonds or sesame seeds</strong>: Add texture and a nutty finishing touch.</li>
            <li><strong>Water or light broth</strong>: Forms the braising liquid that turns into a rich sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt</strong>: Essential for balancing and highlighting all flavors.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Ingredients for two people</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>600 g lamb shoulder or beef chuck, cut into large chunks</li>
            <li>2 medium onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon or 1 small cinnamon stick</li>
            <li>A pinch of saffron threads or ½ teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)</li>
            <li>500 ml water or light broth</li>
            <li>100 g dried prunes or apricots</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons toasted almonds or sesame seeds (optional)</li>
            <li>2–3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro and/or parsley</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1: <em>Prepare the base</em></strong> Heat the olive oil in a tagine or heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook gently until soft and lightly golden, then add the garlic and cook briefly until fragrant.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2: <em>Bloom the spices</em></strong> Lower the heat and stir in the cumin, ginger, black pepper, cinnamon, saffron (or turmeric), and salt. Let the spices warm in the oil for about one minute to release their aromas.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3: <em>Brown the meat</em></strong> Add the meat pieces and turn them well so they are coated in the spiced onion mixture. Cook for several minutes until lightly browned on all sides.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4: <em>Start the slow cook</em></strong> Pour in the water or light broth, almost covering the meat. Bring to a gentle simmer, cover, and reduce the heat to low to begin slow cooking.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 5: <em>Let it braise</em></strong> Allow the tagine to cook slowly for 1½ to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the meat is tender and the sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 6: <em>Add the dried fruits</em></strong> About 30 minutes before the end of cooking, gently stir in the prunes or apricots so they soften and sweeten the sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 7: <em>Adjust and finish</em></strong> Taste the sauce and adjust seasoning if needed, then turn off the heat and sprinkle with fresh cilantro and/or parsley.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 8: <em>Garnish and serve</em></strong> Top with toasted almonds or sesame seeds if using, and serve hot with Moroccan bread or couscous.</li>
        </ol>
