    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Layered pasta, cheese, sauce perfection. Lasagna is comfort dressed in layers: tender sheets of pasta wrapped around rich, slow-simmered sauce, creamy cheese, and deeply savory fillings. Each bite is warm, indulgent, and familiar, the kind of food that makes time slow down and conversations linger just a little longer.
    </p>
    <p>
        It arrives bubbling and golden, filling the room with an irresistible aroma that promises satisfaction before the first forkful. Lasagna isn’t just a meal—it’s an experience of abundance, coziness, and pure, unapologetic pleasure.
    </p>

        <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>

        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>:
            Gather all your ingredients.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong>:
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>:
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong>:
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong>:
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>:
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>:
            To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong>:
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong>:
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 10</strong>:
            Let the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before cutting; this helps it set and firm up.
        </li>
